Welcome to Axelrod's documentation!
===================================

This project is both:

* A python library that reproduces Axelrod's tournament.
* A github experiment allowing anyone to contribute a strategy.

The documentation is still very sparse but take a look at the github repository here: `<https://github.com/drvinceknight/Axelrod>`_.
