Overview of strategies
======================

Axelrod's first tournament
--------------------------

Axelrod's first tournament is described in his 1980 paper entitled `'Effective
choice in the Prisoner's Dilemma' <http://www.jstor.org/stable/173932>`_. This
tournament included 14 strategies and they are listed below, (ranked in the
order in which they appeared).

An indication is given as to whether or not this strategy is implemented in the
:code:`axelrod` library. If this strategy is not implemented please do send us a
`pull request <https://github.com/Axelrod-Python/Axelrod/pulls>`_.

Tit for Tat
^^^^^^^^^^^

This strategy was referred to as the *'simplest'* strategy submitted. It
begins by cooperating and then simply repeats the last moves made by the
opponent.

*Tit for Tat came 1st in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is a quick implementation of this in the library::

   import axelrod
   p1 = axelrod.TitForTat()  # Create a player that plays tit for tat
   p2 = axelrod.Cooperator()  # Create a player that always cooperates
   for round in range(5):
       p1.play(p2)

   print p1.history

which gives::

   ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C']

We see that Tit for Tat cooperated every time, let us see how things change
when it plays against a player that always defects::

   p1 = axelrod.TitForTat()  # Create a player that plays tit for tat
   p3 = axelrod.Defector()  # Create a player that always cooperates
   for round in range(5):
       p1.play(p3)
   print p1.history

which gives::

   ['C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D']

We see that after cooperating once, Tit For Tat defects at every step.

**Not implemented**: Tideman and Chieruzzi
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This strategy begins by playing Tit For Tat and then things get slightly
complicated:

1. Every run of defections played by the opponent increases the number of
   defections that this strategy retaliates with by 1.
2. The opponent is given a 'fresh start' if:

   * it is 10 points behind this strategy
   * **and** it has not just started a run of defections
   * **and** it has been at least 20 rounds since the last 'fresh start'
   * **and** there are more than 10 rounds remaining in the tournament
   * **and** the total number of defections differs from a 50-50 random sample by at
     least 3.0 standard deviations.

A 'fresh start' is a sequence of two cooperations followed by an assumption that
the game has just started (everything is forgotten).

*This strategy came 2nd in Axelrod's original tournament.*

**Not implemented**: Nydegger
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This strategy begins by playing Tit For Tat for the first 3 rounds with the
following modifications:

**If it is the only strategy to cooperate in the first round and the only
strategy to defect on the second round then it defects on the 3 round
(despite the fact that Tit For Tat would now cooperate).**

After these first 3 rounds the next move is made depending on the previous 3
rounds. A score is given to these rounds according to the following
calculation:

.. math::

    A = 16 a_1 + 4 a_2 + a_3

Where :math:`a_i` is dependent on the outcome of the previous :math:`i` th
round.  If both strategies defect, :math:`a_i=3`, if the opponent only defects:
:math:`a_i=2` and finally if it is only this strategy that defects then
:math:`a_i=1`.

Finally this strategy defects if and only if:

.. math::

    A \in \{1, 6, 7, 17, 22, 23, 26, 29, 30, 31, 33, 38, 39, 45, 49, 54, 55, 58, 61\}

*This strategy came 3rd in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Grofman
^^^^^^^

This is a pretty simple strategy: it cooperates with probability :math:`\frac{2}{7}`. In contemporary terminology, this is a memory-one player
with all four conditional probabilities of cooperation equal to :math:`\frac{2}{7}`.

*This strategy came 4th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is how Grofman is implemented in the library::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.Grofman()  # Create a Grofman player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(5):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history

which gives::

    ['C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D']

Over a longer number of rounds::

    from collections import Counter
    for round in range(5):
        p1.play(p2)
    counter = Counter(p1.history)
    print(counter)
    Counter({'D': 367, 'C': 138})
    print float(counter['C']) / (counter['C'] + counter['D'])
    print 2./7

We have that Grofman cooperates roughly in :math:`\frac{2}{7}`-ths of the rounds::

    0.2732673267326733 # Grofman
    0.2857142857142857 # 2./7

Shubik
^^^^^^

This strategy plays a modification of Tit For Tat. It starts by retaliating
with a single defection but the number of defections increases by 1 each time
the opponent defects when this strategy cooperates.

*This strategy came 5th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is how Shubik is implemented in the library::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.Shubik()  # Create a Shubik player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(13):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history
    print p2.history

This yields the following history of play::

    ['C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'C']
    ['D', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D']

The increasing retaliation periods are visible in the output. Note that
Shubik defects if both players defected in the previous round but does
not increase the retaliation period.

**Not implemented**: Stein
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This strategy plays a modification of Tit For Tat.

1. It cooperates for the first 4 moves.
2. It defects on the last 2 moves.
3. Every 15 moves it makes use of a `chi-squared
   test<http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chi-squared_test>`_ to check if the
   opponent is playing randomly.

*This strategy came 6th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Grudger
^^^^^^^

This strategy cooperates until the opponent defects and then defects forever.

*This strategy came 7th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is how this is implemented in the library::

   import axelrod
   p1 = axelrod.Grudger()  # Create a player that grudger
   p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
   for round in range(5):
       p1.play(p2)

   print p1.history
   print p2.history

which gives (for the random seed used)::

    ['C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D']
    ['C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'D']

We see that as soon as :code:`p2` defected :code:`p1` defected for the rest of
the play.

Davis
^^^^^

This strategy is a modification of Grudger. It starts by cooperating for the
first 10 moves and then plays Grudger.

*This strategy came 8th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Davis is implemented as follows::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.Davis()  # Create a Davis player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(15):
       p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history
    print p2.history

This always produces (at least) 10 rounds of attempted cooperation followed by
Grudger::

    ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D']
    ['D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'D']

**Not implemented**: Graaskamp
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This strategy follows the following rules:

1. Play Tit For Tat for the first 50 rounds;
2. Defects on round 51;
3. Plays 5 further rounds of Tit For Tat;
4. A check is then made to see if the opponent is playing randomly in which case
   it defects for the rest of the game;
5. The strategy also checks to see if the opponent is playing Tit For Tat or
   another strategy from a preliminary tournament called 'Analogy'. If so it
   plays Tit For Tat. If not it cooperates and randomly defects every 5 to 15
   moves.

*This strategy came 9th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

**Not implemented**: Downing
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This strategy attempts to estimate the next move of the opponent by estimating
the probability of cooperating given that they defected (:math:`p(C|D)`) or
cooperated on the previous round (:math:`p(C|C)`). These probabilities are
continuously updated during play and the strategy attempts to maximise the long
term play.

Note that the initial values are :math:`p(C|C)=p(C|D)=.5`.

*This strategy came 10th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Feld
^^^^

This strategy plays Tit For Tat, always defecting if the opponent defects but
cooperating when the opponent cooperates with a gradually decreasing probability
until it is only .5.

*This strategy came 11th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Feld is implemented in the library as follows::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.Feld()  # Create a Feld player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(10):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history
    print p2.history

We can see from the output that Feld defects when its opponent does::

    ['C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'D']
    ['D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D']

The defection times lengthen each time the opponent defects when Feld
cooperates.

Joss
^^^^

This strategy plays Tit For Tat, always defecting if the opponent defects but
cooperating when the opponent cooperates with probability .9.

*This strategy came 12th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

This is a memory-one strategy with four-vector :math:`(0.9, 0, 1, 0)`. Here is
how Joss is implemented in the library::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.Joss()  # Create a Joss player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(10):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history
    print p2.history

This gives::

    ['C', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C']
    ['C', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D']

Which is the same as Tit-For-Tat for these 10 rounds.

Tullock
^^^^^^^

This strategy cooperates for the first 11 rounds and then (randomly) cooperates
10% less often than the opponent has in the previous 10 rounds.

*This strategy came 13th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Tullock is implemented in the library as follows::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.Tullock()  # Create a Tullock player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(15):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history
    print p2.history

This gives::

    ['C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'D']
    ['D', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'C']

We have 10 rounds of cooperation and some apparently random plays afterward.

**Not implemented**: 'Grad Student in Political Science'
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This strategy cooperates with a given probability :math:`P`. This probability
(which has initial value .3) is updated every 10 rounds based on whether the
opponent seems to be random, very cooperative or very uncooperative.
Furthermore, if after round 130 the strategy is losing then :math:`P` is also
adjusted.

*This strategy came 14th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Random
^^^^^^

This strategy plays randomly (disregarding the history of play).

*This strategy came 15th in Axelrod's original tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is how this is implemented in the library::

   import axelrod
   p1 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
   p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
   for round in range(5):
       p1.play(p2)

   print p1.history
   print p2.history

which gives (for the random seed used)::

    ['D', 'D', 'C', 'C', 'C']
    ['D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'C']

Axelrod's second tournament
---------------------------

Work in progress.

Stewart and Plotkin's Tournament (2012)
---------------------------------------

In 2012, Alexander Stewart and Joshua Plotkin ran a variant of Axelrod's
tournament with 19 strategies to test the effectiveness of the then newly
discovered Zero-Determinant strategies.

The paper is identified as *doi: 10.1073/pnas.1208087109* and referred to as
[S&P, PNAS 2012] below. Unfortunately the details of the tournament and the
implementation of  strategies is not clear in the manuscript. We can, however,
make reasonable guesses to the implementation of many strategies based on their
names and classical definitions.

The following classical strategies are included in the tournament:

+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| S&P Name | Long name            | Axelrod Library Name |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ALLC     | Always Cooperate     | `Cooperator`         |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| ALLD     | Always Defect        | `Defector`           |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| TFT      | Tit-For-Tat          | `TitForTat`          |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| GTFT     | Generous Tit-For-Tat | `GenerousTitForTat`  |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| TFT      | TitForTat            | `TitForTat`          |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| TF2T     | Tit-For-Two-Tats     | `TitFor2Tats`        |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| WSLS     | Win-Stay-Lose-Shift  | `WinStayLoseShift`   |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+
| RANDOM   | Random               | `Random`             |
+----------+----------------------+----------------------+

ALLC and TFT are defined above. The remaining classical strategies are defined
below. The tournament also included two Zero Determinant strategies, both implemented in the library. The full table of strategies and results is
[available online](http://www.pnas.org/content/109/26/10134/F1.expansion.html).

ALLD
^^^^

ALLD always defects.

*ALLD came last (19th) in average score and 1st in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is a quick implementation of this in the library::

   import axelrod
   p1 = axelrod.Defector()  # Create a player that plays ALLD
   p2 = axelrod.Cooperator()  # Create a player that always cooperates
   for round in range(5):
       p1.play(p2)

   print p1.history

which gives::

   ['D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D']

GTFT
^^^^

Generous-Tit-For-Tat plays Tit-For-Tat with occasional forgiveness, which
prevents cycling defections against itself. The forgiveness factor is given
by :math:`\epsilon`. The value of :math:`\epsilon` in the S&P tournament is not
known and defaults to :math:`\epsilon = 0.05` in the library, defining a
memory-one strategy:

- :math:`P(C\,|\,CC) = 1 - \epsilon`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CD) = \epsilon`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DC) = 1 - \epsilon`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DD) = \epsilon`

*GTFT came 2nd in average score and 18th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Note that some sources define GTFT as TFT but with only an altered probability
of cooperating after a defection, as follows:

- :math:`P(C\,|\,CC) = 1`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CD) = p`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DC) = 1`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DD) = p`

where :math:`p = \text{min}\left(1 - \frac{T-R}{R-S}, \frac{R-P}{T-P}\right)`.
[S&P, PNAS 2012] does not specify how GTFT is defined.

Implementation
**************

Here is a quick implementation of this in the library::

   import axelrod
   p1 = axelrod.GTFT()  # Create a player that plays GTFT
   p2 = axelrod.Defector()  # Create a player that always defects
   for round in range(10):
       p1.play(p2)

   print p1.history

this gives (for the random seed used)::

    ['C', 'D', 'D', 'C', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D', 'D']

which shows that :code:`GTFT` tried to forgive :code:`Defector`.

TF2T
^^^^

Tit-For-Two-Tats is like Tit-For-Tat but only retaliates after two defections
rather than one. This is not a memory-one strategy.

*TF2T came 3rd in average score and last (?) in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is the implementation of this in the library::

   import axelrod
   p1 = axelrod.TitFor2Tats()  # Create a player that plays TF2T
   p2 = axelrod.Defector()  # Create a player that always defects
   for round in range(3):
       p1.play(p2)

   print p1.history

which gives::

    ['C', 'C', 'D']

we see that it takes 2 defections to trigger a defection by :code:`TitFor2Tats`.

WSLS
^^^^

Win-Stay-Lose-Shift is a strategy that shifts if the highest payoff was not
earned in the previous round. WSLS is also known as "Win-Stay-Lose-Switch" and
"Pavlov". It can be seen as a memory-one strategy as follows:

- :math:`P(C\,|\,CC) = 1`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CD) = 0`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DC) = 0`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DD) = 1`

*TF2T came 7th in average score and 13th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is a quick implementation of this in the library::

   import axelrod
   p1 = axelrod.WinStayLoseShift()  # Create a player that plays WSLS
   p2 = axelrod.Cooperator()  # Create a player that always cooperates
   for round in range(5):
       p1.play(p2)

   print p1.history

RANDOM
^^^^^^

RANDOM is a strategy that presumably cooperates or defects randomly with
equal probability. This is also a memory-one strategy:

- :math:`P(C\,|\,CC) = 0.5`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CD) = 0.5`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DC) = 0.5`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DD) = 0.5`

*RANDOM came 8th in average score and 8th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is a quick implementation of this in the library::

   import axelrod
   p1 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays WSLS
   p2 = axelrod.Cooperator()  # Create a player that always cooperates
   for round in range(5):
       p1.play(p2)

   print p1.history

ZDGTFT-2
^^^^^^^

This memory-one strategy is defined by the following four conditional
probabilities based on the last round of play:
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CC) = 1`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CD) = 1/8`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DC) = 1`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DD) = 1/4`

*This strategy came 1st in average score and 16th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is how ZDGTFT-2 is implemented in the library::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.ZDGTFT2()  # Create a ZDGTFT-2 player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(5):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history

EXTORT-2
^^^^^^^^

This memory-one strategy is defined by the following four conditional
probabilities based on the last round of play:
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CC) = 8/9`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CD) = 1/2`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DC) = 1/3`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DD) = 0`

*This strategy came 18th in average score and 2nd in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is how EXTORT-2 is implemented in the library::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.EXTORT2()  # Create a EXTORT-2 player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(5):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history

GRIM
^^^^

Grim is not defined in [S&P, PNAS 2012] but it defined elsewhere as follows.
GRIM (also called "Grim trigger"), cooperates until the opponent defects and
then always defects thereafter. In the library this strategy is called
*Fool Me Once*.

*GRIM came 10th in average score and 11th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

Here is how GRIM is implemented in the library::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.FoolMeOnce()  # Create a GRIM player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(5):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history

HARD_JOSS
^^^^^^^^^

HARD_JOSS is not defined in [S&P, PNAS 2012] but is otherwise defined as a
strategy that plays like TitForTat but cooperates only with probability
:math:`0.9`. This is a memory-one strategy with the following probabilities:

- :math:`P(C\,|\,CC) = 0.9`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,CD) = 0`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DC) = 1`
- :math:`P(C\,|\,DD) = 0`

*HARD_JOSS came 16th in average score and 4th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

HARD_JOSS is not explicitly defined in the library but can easily be
instantiated as follows::

    import axelrod
    four_vector = [0.9, 0., 1., 0.]
    p1 = axelrod.MemoryOnePlayer(four_vector)  # Create a memory-one HARD_JOSS Player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(5):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history

**Not implemented?**: HARD_MAJO
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

HARD_MAJO is not defined in [S&P, PNAS 2012] and is presumably the same as
"Hard Majority",
defined as follows: the strategy defects on the first move, defects if the
number of defections of the opponent is greater than or equal to the number of
times it has cooperated, and otherwise cooperates,

*HARD_MAJO came 13th in average score and 5th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

HARD_TFT
^^^^^^^^

Hard TFT is not defined in [S&P, PNAS 2012] but is
[elsewhere](http://www.prisoners-dilemma.com/strategies.html)
defined as follows. The strategy cooperates on the
first move, defects if the opponent has defected on any of the previous three
rounds, and otherwise cooperates.

*HARD_TFT came 12th in average score and 10th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

HARD_TFT is implemented in the library::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.HardTitForTat()  # Create a HARD_TFT player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(5):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history

HARD_TF2T
^^^^^^^^^

Hard TF2T is not defined in [S&P, PNAS 2012] but is elsewhere defined as
follows. The strategy cooperates on the first move, defects if the opponent
has defected twice (successively) of the previous three rounds, and otherwise
cooperates.

*HARD_TF2T came 6th in average score and 17th in wins in S&P's tournament.*

Implementation
**************

HARD_TF2T is implemented in the library::

    import axelrod
    p1 = axelrod.HardTitFor2Tats()  # Create a HARD_TF2T player
    p2 = axelrod.Random()  # Create a player that plays randomly
    for round in range(5):
        p1.play(p2)

    print p1.history

Remaining Strategies
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The remaining strategies are not unambiguously defined in [S&P, PNAS 2012] and
need to be sourced (and implemented):

- CALCULATOR
- PROBE
- PROBE2
- PROBE3
- HARD_PROBE

Strategies implemented in the module
------------------------------------

Work in progress.
