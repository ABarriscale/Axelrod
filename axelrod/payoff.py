    i.e. one row per player, containing one element per opponent (in
    order of player index) which lists payoffs for each repetition.

    nplayers (integer): The number of players in the tournament.
    repetitions (integer): The number of repetitions in the tournament.

    Returns
    -------
    A scores matrix of the form:

    i.e. one row per player which lists the total score for each
    repetition.

    In Axelrod's original tournament, there were no self-interactions
    (e.g. player 1 versus player 1) and so these are also excluded from the
    scores here by the condition on ip and ires.
